# Lazy Fantasy Baseball, for Free

"Best Ball" is a style of fantasy baseball that requires little to no in-season management. You draft a team, then let an algorithm calculate the lineup that maximizes a team's points for the day/week/month.  

Right now, you can only play Best Ball if you pay for it. This project is an attempt to recreate this style of play for free. 

## PHASE 1 - Complete!
Code can pull and store the stats for a list of players for any day of the baseball season and calculate the points that they would generate. Basic discovery around the maximizing algorithm.

## PHASE 2 - In Progress
Connect to a better database than Excel workbooks for storage and retreival of stats data (i.e. SQL), and complete the maximizing algorithm.



Any input is greatly appreciated!
