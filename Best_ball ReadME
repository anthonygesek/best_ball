Best_ball ReadME

There is only one way to play in a "Best Ball" fantasy baseball league right now and it is a pay site.  This project was an idea I had to create a "Best Ball" league for free with your friends.  "Best Ball" is a style of fantasy baseball that requires little to no in season management.  The idea is that you draft a team and then let an algorithm calculate the lineup that maximizes a team's points for the day/week/month.  

This code so far is capable of pulling and storing the stats for a list of players for any day of the baseball season.  The two pices that I haven't finished are:

1) connecting to a better database than excell workbooks for storage and retreival of the stats data

2) the maximizing algorithm is not finished yet.

Any input is greately appreciated!
